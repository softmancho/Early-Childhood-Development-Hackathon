DataDrive2030 is offering an exciting opportunity to analyse a rich child outcomes dataset of over 15000 South African children (aged 50-69 months).

The aim is to identify behaviours and characteristics associated with young children who thrive against the odds. The findings of the analysis will inform the design and pilot of potentially scalable interventions.

Time frame: 18th August-31 August 2022 (submission of report, code and slide deck on the 31 August 2022)

Output: A brief summary report (details to be fleshed out upon agreement) and presentation of findings to the project team in September (10 minutes). You will be free to explore the data using any method. Depending on the quality of the work, there may be further work opportunities, the opportunity to present to a broader stakeholder group and opportunities to publish.

First prize: Up to R10 000
Second prize: Up to R6 000
Third prize: Up to R4 000
